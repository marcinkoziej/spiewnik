Trust me, this is the correct way to play without tuning 
your guitar down.

Verse 1:

G                 Em
Sad,drunk,and poorly
Bm              C
Sleeping really late
G             Bm
Sad,drunk,and poorly
C               Am
Not feeling so great
G          F        F            C
Wandering lost in a town full of frowns
G             Em
Sad,drunk,and poorly
C                   Am  F   D
Dogs digging up the ground

Chorus
G              Em  Bm                     C
And I feel the light in the night and in the day
G              Em             Bm               Am
And I feel the light when the sky's just mud and grey
G               Em Bm                     F    G    F   G
And I feel the night when you tell me it's okay
F                         Am    
You're So Great and I love you...

Tea,tea,and coffee
Helps to start the day
Tea,tea,and coffee
Shaking all the way
Cities alive,a surprise so am I
Tea,tea,and coffee,
Get no sleep today


G              Em  Bm                     C
And I feel the light in the night and in the day
G              Em             Bm               Am
And I feel the light when the sky's just mud and grey
G               Em Bm                     F    G    F   G
And I feel the night when you tell me it's okay
F                         Am    
You're So Great and I love you...
