        C       Am             G
        I was dreaming of the past
                                  Am  Am7
        And my heart was beating fast
                            G    Am
        I began to lose control
                            F
        I began to lose control
     C            A#            F
        I didn't mean to hurt you
        C           A#     D#
        I'm sorry that I made you cry
        C         G       Am       F
        I didn't mean to hurt you
                            C
        I'm just a jealous guy

        I was feeling insecure
        You might not love me any more
        I was shivering inside
        I was shivering inside

        I didn't mean to hurt you
        I'm sorry that I made you cry
        I didn't mean to hurt you
        I'm just a jealous guy

        I was trying to catch your eyes
        Thought that you were trying to hide
        I was swallowing my pain
        I was swallowing my pain

        I didn't mean to hurt you
        I'm sorry that I made you cry
        I didn't mean to hurt you
        I'm just a jealous guy
