This is the greatest and best song in the world...
Tribute...

A long time ago, me and my brother Kyle here, were Hitch Hiking down a long and
winding road....when all of a sudden there shined a shiney demon...... In the
middle... of the road, AND HE SAID

a-00000000000000000-- (palm Mute)
E--------------------
Play the best song in the world... or i will eat your souls....

Am*
    So me and Kyle... we just looked at each other... and we each said!...OK!

       Am                         G                         F
So we played the first thing that came to our heads and it just so 
                      Am                   G               F
happened to be... the best song in the world it was the best song in 

the world...

D                           F                    C               G    
Look into my eyes and it\'s clear to see... 1 and 1 make 2, 2 and 1 
              F  
make 3 it was destiny.

D                           F                    C                  
Once every hundred thousand years or so when the sun does shine and 
     G                      F        
the moon doth glow and the grass doth growoooooooo!


Am*
Well needless to say...the beast was stund... A WHIPCRACK WITH HIS WHOOPY
TAIL...and the beast was done.

Am*
He asked us...\"be you angels\"...and we said \"NA!! We are but men! ROCK!
