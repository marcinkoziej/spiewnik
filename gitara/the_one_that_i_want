YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I WANT   from   GREASE
==========================================
(John Travolta/Olivia Newton-John)

I was very surprised, that I couldn't find songs from GREASE not only any-
where on OLGA, but even on whole i-net. The same appeared songs from Olivia
Newton-John. So I decided to create this directory and I've sent here some
songs:    SUMMER NIGHTS (from GREASE)
         *YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I WANT (from GREASE)
          TAKE ME HOME COUNTRY ROADS (Olivia)
I hope I will make out more songs. "WE GO TOGETHER (from GREASE)" should be
the next one.
I would be very thankful if tab some songs somebody else too.
Please send me any corrections to e-mail: pirat@gamca.sk


VERSE:

      Am                                   F         C
I got chills, they're multiplyin', and I'm losin' control
           E            Am
'Cause the power you're supplyin', it's electrifyin'

                 C            G           Am                     F
You better shape up, 'cause I need a man, and my heart is set on you
                 C              G           Am                    F
You better shape up, you better understand, to my heart I must be true
F
Nothing left, nothing left for me to do


CHORUS:
           C                                                 F
You're the one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
    C                                                 F
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
    C                                                 F
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh
F         G
The one I need (the one I need), oh yes indeed (yes indeed)


VERSE:

Am                                      F             C
If you're filled with affection, you're too shy to convey
    E         Am
Meditate my direction,  feel your way

               C             G
I better shape up, cause you need a man    I need a man,
Am                   F
who can keep me satisfied
               C          G
I better shape up, if I'm gonna prove      You better prove,
Am                    F
that my faith is justified

F
Are you sure?

Yes I'm sure down deep inside
