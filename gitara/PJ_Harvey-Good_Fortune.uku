"Good Fortune"


Am       G         
Threw my bad fortune
Am       G       
off the top of a 
Am    G       
a tall building
Am         G 
I'd rather done 
        C
it with you


Your boy's smile
Five in the morning
Looked into your eyes
And I was really in love

In Chinatown
Hungover
You showed me
Just what I could do

Talking about
Time travel
And the meaning
And just what it was worth

Am     G        C            D
And I feel like some bird of paradise
Am     G       C           D
My bad fortune slipping away
Am     G       C         D    
And I feel the innocence of a child
C           G5 i think? (0235)
Everybody's got something good to say

Things I once thought
Unbelievable
In my life
Have all taken place

When we walked through
Little Italy
I saw my reflection
Come right off your face

I paint pictures
To remember
You're too beautiful
To put into words

Like a gypsy
You dance in circles
All around me
And all over the world

And I feel like....

So I take my
Good fortune
And I fantasize
Of our leaving
Like some modern-day
Gypsy landslide

Like some modern-day
Bonnie and Clyde
On the run again
