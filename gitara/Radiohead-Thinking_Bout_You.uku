Been thinkin 'bout  you, your records up here
G             Gsus4 G                Gsus4 D  
Your eyes on my wall,  your teeth are over there
              Em       Em7          D     G
But I'm still no-one, and you're a star
        Gsus4  G
What do you care

Been thinkin 'bout  you, and there's no rest
G             Gsus4 G                Gsus4 D  
Should I still love  you, still see you in bed
                     Em      Em7        D     G
But I'm playin' with myself, what do you care

When the other men are far far better

All the things you got, all the things you need

To come and see you, honey

G               Gsus4    G                 Gsus4            D  
These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
                           Em   Em7  D         G
But they don't know what I know, why should you care
     Gsus4    G
When I'm not there
