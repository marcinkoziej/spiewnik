I swapped my innocence for pride
   G
Crushed the end within my stride
   Am   G
Said 'I'm strong now I know that I'm a leaver"

I love the sound of you walking away
   C   G       Am
Mascara bleeds a blackened tear
   C
And I am cold
   G
Yes I'm cold
       Em
But not as cold as you are
   C      G   Am   G

   C      G   Am
I love the sound of you walking away
