Song To The Siren by John Frusciante






G           D

Long afloat on shipless oceans

C            Em

I did all my best to smile

G                D

'Til your singing eyes and fingers

C              Em

Drew me loving to your isle





G             F           Em                  G

And you sang, Sail to me, Sail to me, Let me unfold you

Em                    D          C    Em

Here I am, Here I am, Waiting to hold you





G           D

Did I dream you dreamed about me?

C                  Em

Were you here when i was full sail

G              D

Now my foolish boat is leaning

C               Em

Broken lovelorn on your rocks,





G             F              Em                      G

For you sing, "Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow

Em                     D              C  Em

O my heart, O my heart shies from the sorrow"





G            D

I am puzzled as the newborn child

C             Em

I am troubled at the tide

G              D

Should I stand amid the breakers?

C                 Em

Should I lie with Death my bride?





G             F            Em                 G

Hear me sing, "Swim to me, Swim to me, Let me unfold you

Em                    D          C    Em

Here I am, Here I am, Waiting to hold you"

Waiting to hold you".
