There Is A Light That Never Goes Out
by The Smiths

Transcribed by John S. Jacob (jsjacob@soda.berkeley.edu)

  The lyrics are right out of the insert to "The Smiths I Best..."
  Yes, the chords sound picked, but I prefer to pound out (strum)
  the chords and sing along. I mean, aren't these lyrics so
  uplifting?! ;-)

  As for rhythm, I always say go find a recording -- it's much
  easier than trying to get it from a transcription (or to put
  it into one, for that matter...)

##Capo up to the fourth fret (This song is really in the key of E).


Intro:

  Am F G


Am G       Am G   F    C G
   Take me out tonight

              Am                G
where there's music and there's people

        Am        G F  C G
who are young and alive


Am      G       Am  G
Driving in your car

  F                      C
I never never want to go home

G                 Am      G Am G
because I haven't got one

   F    C G
anymore


Am G       Am G   F    C G
   Take me out tonight

          Am          G
because I want to see people and I

Am          G      F C G
want to see lights


Am      G       Am  G
Driving in your car

   F                    C
oh please don't drop me home

G                Am            G
because it's not my home, it's their

              Am         G     F C G
home, and I'm welcome no more


Chorus:

  Em F

  G        C             Am
  And if a double-decker bus

  F               G
  crashes into us

            C
  to die by your side

         F               G
  such a heavenly way to die


           C         Am
  And if a ten ton truck

  F                    G
  kills the both of us

            C
  to die by your side

      F                         G
  the pleasure the privilege is mine


Am G       Am G   F    C G
   Take me out tonight

           Am                G    Am G F C G
oh take me anywhere, I don't care


           Am       G    Am
And in the darkened underpass

  G          F                               C G
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last

            Am           G
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I

Am            G    F C G
just couldn't ask)


Am G       Am G   F    C G
   Take me out tonight

        Am                G    Am G F C G
take me anywhere, I don't care


     Am      G       Am  G
Just driving in your car

  F                      C
I never never want to go home

G                 Am      G Am G
because I haven't got one

          F       C G
I haven't got one


Chorus


Am         G            Am         G
There is a light and it never goes out

F                       C          G
There is a light and it never goes out
